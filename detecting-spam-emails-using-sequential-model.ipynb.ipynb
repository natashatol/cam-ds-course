(1999) created the Spambase data set donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set contains 4,601 emails marked as spam or non-spam by a postmaster or individuals. Fifty-seven features aid in classifying emails as spam (e.g. word frequencies and email characteristics). The Spambase data set is used for developing and benchmarking spam detection models, providing a base for analysing the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.\n","\n","As a data professional, you were tasked by your company to develop a neural network with TensorFlow that can classify emails as spam or non-spam. You were tasked to develop a model based on the Spambase data set.\n","\n","\n","## Objective\n","In this portfolio activity, you’ll create a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify emails as spam or non-spam.\n","\n","You will complete the activity in your Notebook, where you’ll:\n","- create a sequential API\n","- add layers as needed\n","- employ the model pipeline (compile, fit, and evaluate)\n","- present your insights based on the performance of the model.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LIrag9UBW4Gx"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"metadata":{"id":"07jMZscsQLJ6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746272330682,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":40,"user":{"displayName":"natasha","userId":"02157747378207643966"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#
